GH_Repository
=============
These are created or modified scripts to help me do a variety of functions where I work. I attribute a lot of my knowledge to some key people here, to many books, websites, and dissecting the os, installers, and various components I find along the way. As is uasually the case, there is a lot of trial and error, and sometimes breaking a funtional system. I just create another one and do it again.

I hope anything you might find here helps in some way, either directly or indirectly. I have benefitted from the community and it's only right I give back. Thanks and good luck.
